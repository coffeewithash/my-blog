## Algebraic AD-AS Model
1. The Aggregate Demand (AD) Curve
Derived from the intersection of IS and LM curves.

Derivation: Setting IS and LM equations equal and solving for output ($Y$):  (Eq. 9.B.24)

Properties:

• Slope: Downward sloping. $Y$ is a decreasing function of Price ($P$) (assuming constant Money Supply $M$).

• Intercepts/Shifts:

  • Numerator represents the intercept difference ($\alpha_{IS} - \alpha_{LM}$).

  • Shift Right: Increase in Gov purchases (shifts IS up/right) or Increase in $M$ (shifts LM down/right).

2. The Aggregate Supply (AS) Curves
Short-Run (SRAS)

Firms supply output at a fixed price level ($P_{sr}$).

• Equation: 

• Shape: Horizontal line.

Long-Run (LRAS)

Vertical line at full-employment output ($\bar{Y}$).

• Equation: 

3. Equilibrium
Short-Run Equilibrium

Intersection of AD and SRAS. Substitute SRAS ($P_{sr}$) into the AD equation: 

Long-Run Equilibrium

Intersection of AD and LRAS. Occurs where labor, goods, and asset markets are all in equilibrium.

• Output is fixed at 

• Price Level ($P$): Solved by equating AD to LRAS ($\bar{Y}$):  (Eq. 9.B.28 - derived from rearranging AD for P)
